# Country Details API

The **Country Details API** is a .NET Core project designed to streamline the retrieval of country details based on phone numbers. It operates by accepting a phone number as a parameter and extracting the country code for further processing. Developed using .NET 6.0, this API ensures efficiency, security, and seamless integration capabilities.
### Key Features

- **Effortless Country Details Retrieval:** Simplify the process of obtaining country details by providing a phone number
- **Country Code Extraction:**  Extracts the country code from the provided phone number, facilitating accurate identification.
- **Country Details Database Integration:** Utilizes an In Memory database system to store and retrieve comprehensive country details based on the extracted country code.
- **Secure Data Handling:** Ensures secure handling of phone number parameters, guarding against potential security threats such as input validation issues
- **Documentation:**  Incorporates Swagger UI endpoints documentation for straightforward accessibility and ease of integration.
